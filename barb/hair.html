        History of Barbering
    </h1>
    <p class = "center">
The origins of barbers can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Researchers have discovered razor blades dating back to 3500 BC. Barbers were trusted with much more than just haircuts during the Middle Ages. Barbers frequently served as religious priests in ancient Egypt. This developed from the notion that cutting one's hair was necessary to expel evil from one's body after it had entered through the hair. Barbers frequently officiated at religious events like marriages and baptisms due to their 'paranormal skills'.
Barbers were recognized for doing medical procedures including mending broken bones and extracting teeth. They also engaged in an antiquated procedure called "bloodletting," which involved cutting patients in an effort to purportedly cause the body to bleed out diseases.
In 296 B.C., barbering was brought to Rome, where all free males were obliged to be clean-shaven and slaves were required to wear beards, leading to the term "barbarians" being used at the time to characterize groups that had beards. A few Roman barbers rose to prominence as wealthy and powerful business owners who ran establishments that were popular hangouts for members of the upper class as barbering became a daily ritual in Roman culture.
In addition to cutting hair, barbers in the Middle Ages also performed surgery, bloodletting, leeching, fire cupping, enemas, tooth extraction, neck manipulation, cleansing of the ears and scalp, draining of boils, fistula, and lancing of cysts with wicks. This earned them the nickname "barber surgeons."    
In some nations, both the law and superstition continued to be important. Once upon a time, it was frowned upon in England to trim one's nails or hair on Sundays.
Men are now frequently seen sporting a variety of hairstyles, beards, and mustaches in modern culture. Given that men's vanity and fashion have taken center stage in the barbering industry, it is not surprising that this sector has grown to be a multibillion-pound business.
