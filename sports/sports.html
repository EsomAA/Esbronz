        LeBron Raymond James Sr is an American Professional Basketball Player for the <a href="http://lakers.com">Los Angeles Lakers</a> in the <a href="http://nba.com">NBA</a> (National Basketball Association).

        James grew up in Akron, Ohio which was his hometown. He started playing in his high school St Vincent-St. Mary High School where he was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. In 2003, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.
        He led the Cavaliers to their first NBA finals 2007 and also winning the NBA MVP awards in the years 2009 and 2010. Not winning a championiship with Cleveland (in 7 years) made James to try a new challenge; thereby joining the Miami Heat as free agent in 2010. As a result, James won his first 2 NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013.<br>
        In his fifth season, James opted out his contract and went back to the Cavaliers to finally win a championiship in 2016 when they played against Warriors in the finals. In 2018, James signed with the Lakers where in 2020, he won a championship with them.
