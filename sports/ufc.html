            <u>Early life</u>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Israel Adesanya was born 22 July 1989 in Lagos, Nigeria, being the first born in a family of 5 children. His father, Oluwafemi, is an accountant while his mother, Taiwo is a nurse.<br>
            Adesanya schooled in Chrisland School, Opebi and joined its taekwondo after-school club until he was removed by his mother due to a severe injury. In 1999, he moved to Ghana with his family but since his parents want to provide a better education for their children, they decide to relocate to New Zealand when he was 10 years of age. He attended Rotorua Boys' High School.<br> Adesanya was not interested in sports when he was in high school but he had interest in Japanese <a href="http://anime.com">anime</a> such as Death note and the Naruto Series. Although he was bullied during his stay in high school so the beating and mistreatment accounted to his decision to go for martial arts later in life.

           After Adesanya graduated from high school, he enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Computer Design at the Universal College of Learning in Whanganui. Acquiring inspiration from the Muay Thai film, Ong-Bak, Adesanya started training in kickboxing. After two years in college, Adesanya chose to pursue a career in kickboxing and went on to amass an amateur record of 32-0 before turning professional and fighting in China.<br>
           Adesanya moved to Auckland, New Zealand when he was 21 and began training in mixed martial arts under Eugene Bareman at City Kickboxing, with future UFC fighters like Dan Hooker, Kai Kara-France and current UFC Featherweight Champion Alexander Volkanovski.<br>
           Adesanya is fluent in different languages Yoruba, Nigerian Pidgin and English.
